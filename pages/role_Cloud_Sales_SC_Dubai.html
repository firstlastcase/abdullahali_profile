							<h3>Back to the Frontlines</h3>
							<p>As much as I valued my time in China, I missed the <strong>face-to-face connection with customers</strong>. The experience was invaluable, but after <strong>14 months</strong>, I was ready for the next step. In <strong>2010</strong>, my expertise and dedication to the brand opened the door for a return to the <strong>Middle East</strong>—this time, joining the <strong>field service team in Dubai</strong>. I didn’t just bring <strong>deep technical expertise</strong>; I brought an <strong>unwavering drive to learn, adapt, and make an impact</strong>.</p>
							<h2>First role in Sales!</h2>
							<p>By <strong>October 2014</strong>, I had stepped into a new challenge—leading the charge in <strong>Cloud Sales Solutions</strong> for Avaya’s <strong>Private Cloud and Managed Services (APCS)</strong> across the <strong>Middle East &amp; Africa</strong>. The shift was more than just technological; it was about <strong>helping enterprises embrace the cloud as a strategic enabler</strong>—offering them <strong>business communications, collaboration, and contact center solutions as a service</strong>.</p><p>Success in this role wasn’t just about <strong>selling technology</strong>; it was about <strong>architecting sustainable business models</strong>, guiding <strong>sales strategy</strong>, and securing <strong>high-value deals</strong>. I played a key role in protecting and winning <strong>five multi-million-dollar accounts</strong>, providing expertise in <strong>deal structuring, financial modeling, solution validation, and contract negotiations</strong>. Whether it was <strong>qualifying opportunities, optimizing cost structures, or negotiating SLAs</strong>, my focus was on ensuring that every deal was not just closed—but <strong>built for long-term success</strong>.</p><p>Over nearly <strong>three years</strong>, I was involved in <strong>hundreds of customer interactions</strong>, shaping <strong>transformational cloud journeys</strong> for enterprises across the region. From <strong>validating architectures for cloud readiness</strong> to <strong>finalizing complex contracts</strong>, this experience reinforced a truth I had come to live by: <em>success in technology isn’t about what you sell—it’s about the business outcomes you enable</em>.</p>
